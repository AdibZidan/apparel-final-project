# Apparel - Humanitarian Clothing Portal

## Introduction

I had the opportunity to work with **6** wonderful colleagues and we've created an application called **Apparel - Humanitarian Clothing Portal**.

The team consisted of **7** total members; **2** Product Owners, **3** Back-End & **2** Front-End developers.

**Apparel** is a web-application where a humanitarian organization can offer clothes to those in need.

The humanitarian organization receives donated clothes and the users of the application can select the clothes they need from the catalogue and mark them as reserved.

The users can then go to the **Apparel** warehouse and receive them.

In the future, volunteers could sign up to deliver these apparels to the location of the person in need via geolocation.

It was developed with a microservice infrastructure and Scrum.

## My Role After The Project Was Over
Since I'm a very big advocate of learning new technologies and enhancing my programming skills. I took the entitative to fully refactor this project and add unit tests with my own coding style. I've come a long way ever since refactoring this project as I've gained more experience working on real projects as a [*FullStack Software Developer*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adibzidan).

## What I've Learned

Since it was our final project at [The New Austrian Coding School](https://www.newaustriancodingschool.at/).

I've learned to:

* Work with a team in an agile environment
* Adapt and resolve challenges by researching new topics and working with my colleagues
* Handle responsibility and over achieve with the given tasks
* **Angular** and **NodeJS** in depth
* *and many more*
